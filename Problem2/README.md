# Problem 2

You are given a string of text as input. Your job is to **count the number of times each word appears** in the text
and then print all words and their counts **for words that appear more than once**. For this problem, words are defined
as any characters separated by spaces. Punctuation will not be included in the input text, only alphanumeric characters.
Capitalization can be ignored. Output the word (lowercased), a colon, and then the count of the word, **in alphabetical
order.**

**Hint:** Use a map

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> sentence = "The big dog jumped high    over the lazy red fox  and the man with the  red hat sat high  in the chair and laughed"
<b>Output:</b> and: 2 
        high: 2 
        red: 2 
        the: 5
</pre>
